# WriteBrite

It's like Lite Brite, but with words

## About

WriteBrite is a web app which creates a collaborative writing space. Users join a room with other users and one user is selected to go first. That user gets 30 seconds to write the first lines of the story. When their turn ends, a second user is randomly selected and their 30 second turn begins, where they must continue the story started by the first user. This continues until all users feel the story is complete!

This project was developed from Friday, November 13 until Sunday, November 15 at [HackHarvard](http://hackharvard.org/) 2015.

Developed by Cole Clifford (front end) and Joseph Roque (back end), using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, in conjunction with Node.js and socket.io.
